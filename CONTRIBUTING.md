# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our Teeth Segmentation project! We value your interest and efforts in enhancing the capabilities and quality of our software.

To contribute, here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

- **Fork the Repository:** Begin by forking the repository on GitHub. This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

- **Clone the Forked Repository:** Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command. This step allows you to work on the files locally.

  ```bash
  git clone [URL of your forked repository]
  ```

- **Create a New Branch:** Before making any changes, switch to a new branch using the `git checkout` command. You can name the branch anything you want, but it's recommended to use a descriptive name that reflects the changes you're going to make.

  ```bash
  git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
  ```

- **Make Changes:** Make the necessary changes or additions to the code in your local repository. Focus on making changes that are clear and address specific issues or enhancements.

- **Test Your Changes:** After implementing your changes, test them thoroughly to ensure they work as intended and don't introduce any new issues.

- **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes to the branch with a clear and detailed commit message. This helps us understand the changes you've made and why you made them.

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "your commit message"
  ```

- **Push Your Changes:** Push your changes from your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.

  ```bash
    git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
  ```

- **Submit a Pull Request:** Once your changes are pushed, submit a pull request (PR) to the main repository. In your PR description, provide details about the changes and their purpose. Make sure to reference any related issues.

- **Await Review:** Your PR will be reviewed by the maintainers of the project. Be responsive to any feedback or requests for changes.
